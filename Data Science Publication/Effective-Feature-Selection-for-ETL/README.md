# Effective-Feature-Selection-for-Extraction-Transformation-and-Loading-ETL-

Efficient Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (E-ETL) In the field of data science, Data warehouse plays an important role in decision making, data analysis, and strategic information and so on. Extraction Transformation and Loading (ETL) process is used very popularly in building up of the data warehouse. In today's competitive business world Mergers and Acquisitions are very common. In requires Extraction, Transformation and Loading of huge amount of Organizational Data movement. This work proposed an improvement of D-ETL by adding “Noise-free filtering” and “Attribute selection algorithm”. This existing approach modified to apply both the standard method of extraction, the full extraction and Incremental Extraction procedures in the ETL process. In this thesis we are proposing a complete new EFFICIENT-ETL (E-ETL), which is updated version of Dynamic ETL (D-ETL). We have added a noise-free feature and proper attribute selection technique in D-ETL for do better works for a human being. It can reduce too many problems.
